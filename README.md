# odin-recipes
Odin-recipes is going to be a multi-page recipes website, a project 
designed to assess the student's understanding about HTML. The project 
will be created using links, images, headings, paragraphs and lists, 
among many other HTML elements. By the end of this project, the student 
shall be familiar with carrying out multiple GIT commits, pulls and 
pushes.
